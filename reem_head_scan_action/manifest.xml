An Action Server to move the head and take PointCloud snapshots

Used as part of the perception system, to provide an easy method to request the robot to scan an area and aggregate the snapshots of PointCloud data e.g. scanning a table with head-mounted RGBD sensor and building a Collision Map

The same behaviour could be accomplished be repeatedly calling the Point Head Action Server with some x-y co-ordinates, but this node offers a specific "scan the table" behaviour.

When requested, the robot will perform the following hard-coded behaviour:
1. look straight ahead, snapshot
2. look left, snapshot
3. look right, snapshot
4. look down-left, snapshot
5. look down-right, snapshot
6. look down-center, snapshot
